Zombie Awareness

An enhancement to the core of Minecrafts entities, the main focus being a re-activation of pathfinding and increased awareness.

Main Features:
--------------

- Entities use pathfinding to aquire their targets, they no longer just move right towards you.
- Scent based awareness that causes monsters to track blood spilt by animals or the player
- Sound based awareness that causes monsters to track loud or heavily repeated noises, gives mining in caves a whole new challenge
- Customizable PF range and PF usage exception list

Zombie Awareness also contains a basic entity AI API for a few hooks that I required in Pets Mod and Nightmare Mode, more details on the hooks available are in BaseEntityHooks.java
